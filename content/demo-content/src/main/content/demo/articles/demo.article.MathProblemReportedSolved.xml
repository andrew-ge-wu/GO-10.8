    <component group="body" name="value">&lt;p&gt;Vinay Deolalikar, a mathematician who works for
      HP Labs, claims to have proven that P is not equal to NP. The problem is the greatest unsolved
      problem in theoretical computer science and is one of seven problems in which the Clay
      Mathematics Institute has offered million dollar prizes to the solutions.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
      &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
      &lt;p&gt;The question of whether P equals NP essentially
      asks whether there are categories of problems where
      short proofs exist but finding those proofs
      is difficult. More formally, a problem is said to
      be in P if running the problem there is a
      program for a Turing machine, an ideal theoretical
      computer with unbounded amounts of memory,
      such that running instances of the problem through
      the program will always answer the question
      in time bounded by the length of the input. A
      problem is said to be in NP, if the problem can
      be solved in polynomial time when it is
      instead of being run on a Turing machine, it is run on
      a non-deterministic Turing machine,
      which is like a Turing machine but it the machine is able
      to make copies of itself to try
      different approaches to the problem
      simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
      &lt;p&gt;Mathematicians have
      long believed that P does not equal NP, and the question has many practical implications.
      Much
      of modern cryptography, such as the RSA algorithm and the Diffie-Hellman algorithm, rests
      on
      certain problems, such as factoring integers, being in NP and not in P. If it turned out
      that
      P=NP, these methods would not work but many now difficult problems would likely be easy
      to
      solve. If P does not equal NP then many natural, practical problems such as the traveling
      salesman problem are intrinsically difficult.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
      &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
      &lt;p&gt;In 2000, the Clay Foundation listed the
      &amp;quot;Clay Millenium Problems,&amp;quot; seven
      mathematical problems each of which they
      would offer a million dollars for a correct solution.
      One of these problems was whether P
      equaled NP. Another of these seven, the
      Poincar&amp;eacute; conjecture, was solved in 2002 by
      Grigori Perelman who first made
      headlines for solving the problem and then made them again
      months later for refusing to take
      the prize money.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;

      &lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
      &lt;p&gt;On August 7, mathematician Greg Baker noted on his
      blog that he had seen a draft of a claimed proof
      by Deolalikar although among experts a draft
      had apparently been circulating for a few days.
      Deolalikar's proof works by connecting certain
      ideas in computer science and finite model
      theory to ideas in statistical mechanics. The proof
      works by showing that if certain problems
      known to be in NP were also in P then those problems
      would have impossible statistical
      properties. Computer scientists and mathematicians have
      expressed a variety of opinions about
      Deolalikar's proof, ranging from guarded optimism to near
      certainty that the proof is
      incorrect. Scott Aaronson of Massachusetts Institute of Technology
      has expressed his pessimism
      by stating that he will give $200,000 of his own money to
      Deolalikar if the proof turns out to
      be valid. Others have raised specific technical issues
      with the proof but noted that the proof
      attempt clearly presented interesting new techniques
      that would be relevant to computer
      science whether or not the proof turns out to be correct.
      Richard Lipton, a professor of
      computer science at Georgia Tech, has said that &amp;quot; the
      author certainly shows
      awareness of the relevant obstacles and command of literature supporting
      his
      arguments.&amp;quot; Lipton has listed four central objections to the proof, none of which
      are
      necessarily fatal but may require more work to address. It will likely take months for
      experts
      to reach a consensus on whether the proof is valid and if it is not valid in its
      current form
      whether the proof can be corrected to a valid proof.&lt;/p&gt;&#13;
