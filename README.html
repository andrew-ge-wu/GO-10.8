      Greenfield Times is an example on how to build and structure a
      best practice web application project using Polopoly.

    <p>
      Maven is used to install and run the development environment.
      Run mvn -version to verify that Maven is installed on your system.
      <b>Maven 3.0.3 or greater is required</b>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Classical Greenfield Times development using ant is
      also supported, and still required for production deployment.
